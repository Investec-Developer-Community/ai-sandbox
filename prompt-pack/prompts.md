## üè¶ Programmable Banking Card Prompts

### 1. Build a simple spending tracker for Investec card
```
I'm using the Investec Programmable Banking API. Help me build a Node.js script that:
1. Fetches my card transactions from the last 7 days using GET /za/pb/v1/accounts/{id}/transactions
2. Categorizes spending by merchant type
3. Sends me a daily summary via email

Authentication pattern (client_credentials flow):
const auth = Buffer.from('client_id:client_secret').toString('base64');
const tokenResp = await fetch('https://openapisandbox.investec.com/identity/v2/oauth2/token', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Basic ${auth}`,
    'x-api-key': 'your-api-key',
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
  },
  body: 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=accounts'
});

Use these mock credentials for testing:
- client_id: mock-client
- client_secret: mock-secret
- api_key: mock-api-key
- base_url: http://localhost:3000

Include error handling for rate limits and token refresh. Show me the complete working code with comments.
```

### 2. Create a card spending limit alert system
```
Build a Python script using the Investec Programmable Banking API that:
1. Monitors real-time card transactions using GET /za/pb/v1/accounts/{id}/transactions
2. Tracks spending against monthly budgets by category (groceries, fuel, entertainment)
3. Sends WhatsApp alerts when I'm 80% of budget in any category
4. Includes a "pause card" function if spending exceeds limits

Correct Investec authentication (client_credentials):
import base64
import requests

def get_access_token():
    auth = base64.b64encode(f"{client_id}:{client_secret}".encode()).decode()
    response = requests.post(
        'https://openapisandbox.investec.com/identity/v2/oauth2/token',
        headers={
            'Authorization': f'Basic {auth}',
            'x-api-key': api_key,
            'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
        },
        data='grant_type=client_credentials&scope=accounts'
    )
    return response.json()['access_token']

Mock environment:
- client_id: mock-client
- client_secret: mock-secret
- api_key: mock-api-key
- API base: http://localhost:3000

Show complete code with proper async handling and webhook setup.
```

### 3. Auto-save spare change from card purchases
```
Help me code an Investec card "spare change" feature that:
1. Rounds up every card purchase to the nearest R10
2. Transfers the difference to my savings account
3. Tracks total savings accumulated
4. Sends monthly progress reports

Correct API endpoints to use:
- GET /za/pb/v1/accounts/{accountId}/transactions for card purchases
- POST /za/pb/v1/accounts/{accountId}/transfers for savings transfers

Authentication using client_credentials flow:
const getToken = async () => {
  const auth = Buffer.from(`${client_id}:${client_secret}`).toString('base64');
  const response = await fetch('https://openapisandbox.investec.com/identity/v2/oauth2/token', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Basic ${auth}`,
      'x-api-key': api_key,
      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
    },
    body: 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=accounts'
  });
  return response.json();
};

Mock credentials: 
- client_id: mock-client
- client_secret: mock-secret
- api_key: mock-api-key

Include proper OAuth flow and error handling. Language: JavaScript/Node.js.
```

## üîß Quick Setup & Testing Prompts

### 4. Spin up local Investec mock server with realistic data
```
Set up a local mock server for Investec APIs with:
1. Realistic South African banking transaction data (groceries, fuel, restaurants)
2. Multiple account types (current, savings, credit card)
3. Programmable Banking card transaction webhooks
4. OAuth client_credentials token endpoints that work with Basic Auth + x-api-key

Use the correct Investec API endpoints:
- GET /za/pb/v1/accounts
- GET /za/pb/v1/accounts/{id}/balance
- GET /za/pb/v1/accounts/{id}/transactions

Base URL: http://localhost:3000
Include Docker setup and chaos testing (latency/errors).
```

### 5. Generate OAuth client_credentials flow for Investec sandbox
```
Create a complete OAuth 2.0 client_credentials implementation for Investec API testing:
1. Token request using Basic Auth + x-api-key headers
2. Proper grant_type=client_credentials flow
3. Automatic token refresh handling
4. Error handling for expired/invalid tokens

Correct authentication pattern:
const auth = Buffer.from(`${client_id}:${client_secret}`).toString('base64');
const response = await fetch('https://openapisandbox.investec.com/identity/v2/oauth2/token', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Basic ${auth}`,
    'x-api-key': apiKey,
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
  },
  body: 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=accounts'
});

Mock credentials:
- client_id: mock-client
- client_secret: mock-secret
- api_key: mock-api-key

Show both web-based and CLI approaches. Include testing examples.
```
